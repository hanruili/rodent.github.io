---

# **Motivation**
Rodents in urban areas like New York City pose serious public health risks, from spreading diseases and contaminating food supplies to causing infrastructure damage. Addressing rodent activity is crucial for improving urban sanitation and residents' quality of life. This report examines rodent inspection data, food scrap drop-off locations, and socioeconomic indicators to uncover the factors influencing rodent activity patterns.

---

# **Related Work**
Rodents have long been a public health concern in NYC, spreading diseases like:
- **Leptospirosis**
- **Hantavirus**
- **Food contamination and infrastructure damage**

### Key Studies
- **Auerbach (2014)** estimated NYC has 2 million rats.
- **Parsons et al. (2021)** and **Bedoya-Pérez et al. (2021)** emphasized societal costs like food contamination, infrastructure damage, and economic losses.

---

# **Research Questions**
We focused on understanding the relationships between rodent activity and key influencing factors, such as **temporal trends**, **geographic distribution**, and **socioeconomic conditions**.

1. **Temporal Trends in Rodent Activity**  
   - How does rodent activity vary across years and months?

2. **Geographic Distribution**  
   - How is rodent activity distributed across different boroughs?
   - Are rodent hotspots correlated with food scrap drop-off sites?

3. **Socioeconomic Factors**  
   - How are rental prices and house values related to rodent activity?

4. **Predictive Models**  
   - What’s the best model to predict rodent activity using socioeconomic and geographic data?

# **Exploratory Analysis**
## **Key Steps**
### 1. Temporal Trends
- Aggregated rodent activity data by **month** and **year**.
- Created **line plots** to visualize trends (2020–2024).

### 2. Geographic Distribution
- Mapped food scrap sites and rodent hotspots.
- Identified boroughs with the highest rodent activity.

### 3. Interaction Analysis
- Analyzed overlap between rodent hotspots and food scrap sites.
- Generated interactive maps for July (peak rodent activity month).

---

# **Statistical Models**
### Key Findings:
1. **Rental Prices**:  
   Minimal effect on rodent activity, but statistically significant.
   $$\log\left[\frac{P(\text{rodent activity} = 1)}{1 - P(\text{rodent activity} = 1)}\right] = -0.766 + 0.0000779 \times \text{rental price}$$

2. **House Values**:  
   Slightly negative effect on rodent activity.
   $$\log\left[\frac{P(\text{rodent activity} = 1)}{1 - P(\text{rodent activity} = 1)}\right] = -0.451 - 0.0000001 \times \text{house value}$$

3. **Borough Effects**:  
   - Borough remains the **strongest predictor** of rodent activity.
   - Interaction terms improved model accuracy.

4. **Cross-Validation**:  
   - Adding borough-level interactions reduced model error and improved predictive power.

---

# **Key Findings**
### Temporal Insights
- **Summer peaks** in rodent activity (June–September).
- **Winter drops** likely due to cold weather.

### Geographic Insights
- **Manhattan and Brooklyn** have the highest rodent activity.
- **Staten Island** has the least activity, reflecting lower population density.

### Policy Recommendations
1. **Intensify Control in Summer**:  
   Increase rodent control efforts during peak months.
2. **Target High-Risk Boroughs**:  
   Focus resources on boroughs with the highest activity.
3. **Expand Food Scrap Programs**:  
   Address inequities in food scrap site distribution (e.g., Staten Island).

---

# **Limitations**
1. **Data Completeness**:  
   Rodent inspection data may not capture unreported activity.
2. **Model Complexity**:  
   Interaction terms are significant but difficult to interpret.
3. **Generalizability**:  
   Results are specific to NYC and may not apply to other cities.

---

# **Future Directions**
1. Include variables like restaurant density, trash schedules, and park proximity.
2. Explore weekly or daily temporal trends.
3. Collaborate with communities for actionable insights.
